                "description": "A modular, polyglot architecture has many advantages but it also adds complexity since each incoming request typically fans out to multiple distributed services. For example, in an online store application the information on a product details page - description, price, recommendations, etc - comes from numerous services. To minimize response time and improve scalability, these services must be invoked concurrently. However, traditional concurrency mechanisms are low-level, painful to use and error-prone.\r\n\r\nIn this talk you will learn about some powerful yet easy to use abstractions for consuming web services asynchronously.  We will compare the various implementations of futures that are available on the JVM. You will learn how to access web services using reactive observables (RxJava), which are asynchronous data streams. We will describe how these mechanisms let you write asynchronous code in a very straightforward, declarative fashion.\r\n",

                "description": "Today’s QA organizations often have sizable investments in test automation. Unfortunately running and maintaining your test suites represents a sizable investment. Far too often this hard work is abandoned and teams revert to a more costly, but familiar, manual approach.\r\n \r\nA more practical solution is to integrate your test automation suites with a concept called “continuous integration”. A CI system monitors your source code and compiles the system after every change. Once the build is complete, test suites are automatically run. This approach of ongoing test execution provides your developers rapid feedback and keeps your tests in constant use. It also frees your testers up for more involved exploratory testing.\r\n \r\nJared shows how to set up an open source continuous integration tool and explains the best way for you to introduce this technique to your developers and testers. The concepts are simple when presented properly and provide solid benefits to all areas of an organization.\r\n",

Render the CSS on-the-fly, responding to run-time conditions, either on the server or in the browser. And that's just the beginning. Imagine modifying CSS structure and rule-relationships in process, re-compiling then re-rendering? Yep.\r\n\r\nAre you still excited because your CSS automatically re-compiles on save? CSS.past.

                "description": "Refactoring is a fundamental practice for an agile developer. Each refactoring is a small and isolated activity, but the value comes when you perform a sequence of refactorings to effect larger changes. This workshop will guide participants through hands-on exercises designed to teach three essential skills to become good at refactoring:\r\n\r\n1. Identifying what needs refactoring: what makes code smell, confusing, or complex?\r\n2. Identifying the end goal: what are the design options and which one will yield the best results?\r\n3. Tracing a strategy to get the code from 1 to 2.\r\n\r\nFor the workshop, developers should bring their laptop with a basic working Java environment (JDK 1.6+, Eclipse or IntelliJ), have some knowledge about automated testing (JUnit) and refactorings, and optionally spend some time getting familiar with the code base we will use in the workshop [here](http://git.io/9bm1IA).\r\n\r\nThis workshop has been presented at Agile Brazil 2013, as well as internally at ThoughtWorks.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is co-presented with Mariana Bravo.",

                "description": "Usage of Java components to build applications has grown exponentially. Today, an application consists of 80 - 90% components. And components are a great fit with agile development - using pre-built components speeds development efforts making it possible to shorten development cycles. \r\nMany of these components are open source components that are housed in the Central Repository, the defacto standard used by open source project teams to distribute their binaries. Recent research shows some interesting trends:\r\n8 billion components were downloaded from Central in the last 12 months.\r\n53% of survey respondents are standardizing on an open source development infrastructure stack.\r\n76% of large organizations have no control over what components are being used in software development projects\r\n\r\nAlthough components help improve developer productivity so that applications can be delivered faster, if components are not managed effectively, security, licensing, and quality issues can put your organization at risk. Gartner addresses the need to manage components as part of an overall software supply chain approach: \"IT supply chain integrity issues are expanding from hardware into software and information. They are growing more complex as IT systems are assembled from a large number of geographically diverse providers, and, now of mainstream concern to enterprise IT.\" - Ray Valdes, research vice president at Gartner.\r\n\r\nJoin us as we introduce key concepts for managing and exploiting these components. \r\nWe'll discuss the current state of application development market, the promise and challenge of components\r\nWe'll discuss how components need to be managed throughout the entire software lifecycle\r\nWe'll discuss the ramifications that components have for Agile and DevOps methodologies\r\nWe'll provide you with a set of best practice considerations to kick-start your component management initiative.\r\n",

We need a simple and solid model of software delivery and a measurement system that allows to test their validity. We started such a model and surveyed a 1000 organisations against it.

The dynamic nature of Groovy makes it easier to implement some common patterns. What is better, there are some patterns that you can exploit in Groovy that are not so easy in Java. In this section, you will learn how to implement some traditional patterns in Groovy, and also other patterns you are simply not used to in Java. This presentation will go far beyond the Gang-of-four (GOF) patterns. You will learn how to implement some GOF patterns, but also some patterns that will allow you to exploit dynamic nature of Groovy and the elegance of Groovy closures.",

                "description": "Designing a really clean and intuitive REST + JSON API is no small feat.  You have to worry about resources, collections of resources, pagination, query parameters, references to other resources, which HTTP Methods to use, HTTP Caching, security, and more!  And you have to make sure it lasts and doesn't break clients as you add features over time. Further, while there are many references on creating REST APIs with XML, there are much fewer references for REST + JSON.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, Les Hazlewood - Stormpath CTO and Apache Shiro PMC Chair - will share all of the golden nuggets learned while designing, implementing and supporting JSON-based REST APIs, using examples from a clean real-world REST+JSON API built with Java technologies.  He will cover:\r\n\r\n* JSON-based data formats in a RESTful API\r\n* References to other JSON-based resources (aka 'linking').\r\n* Resource collections and pagination\r\n* How to map (and how not to map) HTTP methods to Resource CRUD\r\n* Resource partial updates\r\n* Supporting HTTP Method Overloading for clients that don't support HTTP PUT and DELETE\r\n* API versioning strategies\r\n* Meaningful Error responses\r\n* Many-to-many resource relationships\r\n* HTTP Caching and Optimistic concurrency control.\r\n* Authentication and Security\r\n",

However, scaling your application into an enterprise-level system introduces more demanding needs.\r\n\r\nThis talk will describe numerous tips and techniques to both increase Hibernate ORM performance, as well as decrease overhead.  These include some basic tricks, such as mapping and fetching strategies.  More complex considerations, Entity enhancement instrumentation, third-party second level caching, Hibernate Search, and other considerations will also be discussed.

NodeJS provides event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that supposedly makes it easy to build scalable network application. In this talk you will learn about the consequences of combining the event-driven programming model with a prototype-based, weakly typed, dynamic language.  We will share our perspective as a server-side Java developer who wasn’t entirely happy about JavaScript in the browser, let alone on the server. You will learn how to use NodeJS effectively in modern, polyglot applications.\r\n",

You will get a chance to see why PaaS is one of the most important trends to affect the application development process. After a few slides on PaaS, we will spend the rest of the time working with code! First we will bring up Tomcat 7 and MySQL with one command. Then you to get your own JEE6 with JBoss EAP code up and running.  We will show you how easy it is to bring in dependencies and deploy your code. We will also demonstrate how to connect your code to a MongoDB back-end data store. We will also have you merge in some of the [Github quickstarts](https://github.com/openshift) we have assembled - including [JEE6 with Mongo Spatial](https://github.com/thesteve0/openshift-mongo-spatial-jee6). There are two goals of this session:\r\n\r\n1) To leave knowing why you should start using a PaaS for your development work\r\n2) Leave with first hand knowledge on how to run your Java code in the cloud for free!\r\n\r\n",

We have introduced practices such as re-factoring and automated tests to help us deal with this insanity. Is there a better way? Micro services based architectures look very promising. But what exactly are micro services? How do you get started? What are the benefits? What are the trade-offs? How do you design them?

Or has the challenge of refactoring from an imperative design to a more functional design proven too daunting of a task until now? Is it difficult to even know where to start?\r\n\r\nThis talk intends to address these challenges both by **contrasting** canonical imperative programming approaches with functional ones, and by **demonstrating** refactoring techniques that can aid in transmuting imperative code into functionally-inspired code.\r\n\r\nSome things to expect in this talk:\r\n\r\n* a very brief overview of some key driving motivators behind FP\r\n* some Ideas around leveraging the strengths of OOP and FP in the same codebase\r\n* a foray into functional iteration patterns and a way to implement them in Java (folds, filters, transforms)\r\n* live demonstrations of refactoring towards those functional representations of imperative designs\r\n* notable performance implications of demonstrated functional approaches\r\n* audience participation in whatever form that naturally takes (questions, suggestions, example problems, collaborative coding)\r\n\r\nSome things **not** to expect in this talk:\r\n\r\n* protracted academic conversations about why to use _Clojure over Scala over Java over C over paper and pen_\r\n* nazis\r\n* death rays\r\n* other things that cause us pain and/or death\r\n\r\nIn the interest of objectivity (and self-preservation), I will attempt to avoid making dogmatic statements like \"of course chocolate is better than vanilla! Communist!\" and other peripheral problematic faux pas. (In case I fail and do it anyway...well, my bad.)",

                "description": "In this day and age it is pretty common to design a large-scale web application as a collection of modular and reusable components. These components need to have a reasonable set of APIs (application programming interfaces) which deliver against the stipulated engineering criteria. In addition this API set needs to retain ease of use. The success of a module is thus reflected in the way it is being used in other modules. This talk is intended to initiate the discussion on finding the principles for designing a good JavaScript API by observing the interactions between modules, particularly on the influence of an interface on the code patterns. Some good and bad examples found in real-world libraries will be shown, along with a collection of language tools designed to detect and analyze those patterns.",

As such, these binaries are exposed to massive request load, similar to a coordinated DDoS attack in the case of popular binaries.  \r\nAdd to that the need to manage metadata support for pricy REST queries; controlling storage quotas; collecting stats; calculating common repository indexes on demand; and across the globe distribution, and look, you’ve got yourself a pretty complicated system to run and manage.\r\n\r\nThis talk will show you how [Bintray](http://bintray.com), JFrog’s social binary distribution service, works, to allow any developer to serve and consume OSS binaries. We will speak about:\r\n\r\n*  how the system is segmented to support massive loads across data centers with full redundancy and stateless vertical scaling; \r\n*  how Grails applications can scale and how we tie up different NoSQL technologies such as CouchDB, MongoDB, ElasticSearch and Redis; \r\n*  We’ll also see how Java technologies, such as Grizzly and Jersey can provide a lightweight alternatives to traditional web technologies; \r\n*  and demonstrate how no-interruption deployments are done to provide continuous distribution of binaries to developers worldwide.\r\n",

                "description": "DevOps is a proven practice for high performing IT organizations.  It is the new buzzword in IT but larger enterprises are having mixed if any success.  Culture change can be a daunting task especially since most of the focus is around operations.  Today its not just about the end user’s experience but also about how quickly the business can deliver new and innovative features to the market.  This is hard when the two sides of this delivery model are opposed to each other.  Operations wants stability and development wants velocity.  With this type of constraint on time and resources the idea of doing right is shadowed by doing it fast.

Lot's of teams don't think about reflecting their development workflow in Git and just use it out-of-the-box. Git, however, can be much more powerful, giving your team a boost in productivity, protecting your delivery pipeline and helping you to work better together.\r\nIn this session we will start with a central workflow that is used by a lot of Subversion teams. You will learn how to practically integrate ALM solutions like continuous deployment, code reviews, change tracking and much more into your individual workflow. You will find out how to protect your master branch from accidental commits, broken builds and unreviewed code.

In this presentation, we're going to take a hard look at NodeJS, from installing it through using it write a variety of different server programs.

                "description": "Cloud computing is driving a new wave of innovation in the area of big data. All types of organizations are continuously looking at ways to improve efficiency of their infrastructure and at the same time manage IT costs effectively. The cloud is paving the way by helping companies with this challenge and by bringing innovation to market. Developers now have access to big data tools in the cloud which can give them the scale they need to either test a new idea or run a large project more cost effectively - and more quickly.\r\nIn this session, we will walk through a real world application where the open source HPCC Systems platform can be launched with three different cloud providers (AWS, HP Public Cloud, or Rackspace) to make Big Data Analytics easier for developers. The Big Data platform can be launched and configured with the click of a button through their Instant Cloud solution built with jclouds.  Apache jclouds is an open source library that helps you get started in the cloud and utilizes your Java development skills. The jclouds API gives you the freedom to use portable abstractions or cloud-specific features.\r\nHPCC Systems provides a single platform that is easy to install, manage, and code. Designed by data scientists, HPCC Systems is a data intensive supercomputer that has evolved for more than a decade. It was built for enterprise customers who needed to process large volumes of data in a 24/7 environment. \r\nAttendees will be shown how to create their own high performance computing cluster and/or query cluster with several different cloud providers using the HPCC Systems platform. Attendees will also be introduced to several production applications of the platform that include near real-time data ingestion, data fabrication, and machine learning.  Taking advantage of HPCC Systems in the cloud provides a powerful combination designed to make data-intensive computing and massively concurrent queries more manageable.",

Writing an application that lazily loads large amounts of data from the server, includes drag-and-drop, keyboard navigation and compelling visualizations would not require writing any HTML, JavaScript or resigning a REST API. While the server centric development model provides the best productivity, Vaadin also supports client-side development though the GWT based Java to JavaScript compiler as well as JavaScript. The default looks of the application can be customized with CSS and SASS.\r\n\r\nThe presentation gives an overview to Vaadin and explain how it works. We'll also discuss on what are the latest new features of Vaadin and how the roadmap looks. The session should give you everything you need to get started building your own apps with the free Apache-licensed Vaadin.",

Once I inevitably mention that I pair program full time and the presentation grinds to a screeching halt as I'm peppered with questions about pair programming, regardless of my actual presentation topic.\r\n\r\nFine! ***Let's do this thing.*** What is pair programming? Why doesn't pair programming make software cost twice as much or take twice as long to develop? Do I pair with the same person every day? Who owns the code? How do performance reviews work? What do I do if my pair is sick? What do I do if I hate my pair? What if my pair is as dumb as a rock?\r\n\r\nWhat if my pair smells bad? What if my pair smells GOOD?!\r\n\r\nI'll answer any and all questions about pair programming and remote pair programming, from the poignant to the silly.

Today's Spring is polyglot, provides a best-in-class REST stack, supports the open web, big-data, and mobile applications. Today's Spring is easy to get started with, easy to learn, and convention-centric. Today's Spring is...Pivotal. Join Spring developer advocate Josh Long as he re-introduces you to today's Spring, a Spring you may not have seen yet. \r\n\r\nThis talk is a broad, running tour of the Spring.iO platform. I'll demonstrate our HATEOAS-compliant and OAuth-secured REST service support, NoSQL and big-data support, websockets support, OAuth and open-web security support and our mobile support. \r\n",

We'll start with architecture and code review of a basic HTML/JavaScript version of a sample charity application. After that we'll switch to its jQuery version, then you'll see how to do it with Ext JS framework, then we'll cut this application into slices for modularization reasons. The second part of this presentation is about moving this application to mobile devices. You'll see this application implemented with Responsive Design principles, and then two more versions: one with jQuery Mobile and the other with Sencha Touch. If time permits, we'll try to review one more version written in a new programming language that Java developers should learn. ",

We’ll dive into challenges faced and discuss with you how we leveraged Spring Batch that greatly accelerated delivery, helped maximize our focus on the business problem, while maintaining the batch jobs’ enterprise quality.\r\nThis session assumes a basic understanding of batch processing and Spring Batch. Michael Minella’s *Spring Batch 101* is recommended if you have no prior exposure to Spring Batch.",

Less mangers managing, less testers testing and less IT-operators operating. The developers take the power back, making them much happier. Sound like paradise? It is!\r\nThis session will show you how we do Kick-Ass Software Development at Atlassian. I will talk about how we: use pull requests for better code quality; collaborate fast to develop ideas; avoid meetings to get more stuff done; tighten our feedback loops to fail faster; shorten our release cycles; and work together happily on different continents. It's a great way to develop software and we think it can work in your company, too. ",

But these new languages, collectively referred to as \"functional\" languages, were nothing new. In fact, they've been a part of the language landscape since the late 80s, and arguably even longer than that. What makes a functional language, and what makes a functional language interesting? Most importantly, why do we care now, thirty years after their introduction?",

But its massive scalability was accompanied by a bare bones feature set, a substantial learning curve, and a Thrift-based RPC mechanism that left newbies bewildered by a sea of potential client libraries--all with their own fragmented semantics. Over the last year that's all changed, culminating in the recently unveiled Cassandra 2.0. In this talk I'll bring you up to speed on Cassandra Query Language, cursors, the new native libraries, lightweight transactions, virtual nodes, and loads of other new goodies. Whether you're completely new to Cassandra or a seasoned veteran who wants the latest scoop, this talk has something for you.",

First, we'll start translating the Java to leverage more Functional Programming concepts. Then, we'll step into Scala and watch the boilerplate melt away.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the topics covered are:\r\n\r\n* Expression oriented programming, the basics of FP\r\n* Simplicity in Design\r\n* Abstracting behaviors\r\n* How Functional and OO programming blend\r\n* Asynchronous programming with Futures and Promises\r\n* Removing edges in libraries with implicit classes and value classes\r\n* Tracking lexical state with implicit values.\r\n",

                "description": "With service virtualization, it is simple to have dependencies emulate different security scenarios that would otherwise be difficult to configure and unfeasible to test against. For instance, with SSL, you could configure acceptable and unacceptable certificates. Or, you could emulate various behaviors related to authorization, authentication, and access controls. You could also configure the dependent system to deliver malicious payloads.  This provides very granular control over the security behavior of the dependencies in your environment. Your standard functional test scenarios can then be run against these different environment configurations. \r\n\r\nWhile standard penetration testing simulates attacks through an API in a non-stateful manner, service virtualization lets you emulate attacks at various levels of the system and at different points within a stateful process (e.g., at different points in a logical use case or workflow). This not only broadens your test coverage, but can also expose security vulnerabilities that are manifested only a certain set of environment conditions—and that would not be apparent with non-stateful penetration testing. \r\n\r\nMoreover, service virtualization enables you to apply testing and validation at multiple depths and levels. By applying validations and assertions to the messages from your AUT, you can isolate and zero in on specific components. You could validate a service's response for any indication that its security controls are not working properly (or that additional ones should be implemented). For example, you can determine how the exact element you're testing handles an attempted attack such as an SQL injection. With this direct validation, you gain significantly more visibility into the behavior of a particular component than you can obtain via the output of the larger integrated system.  \r\n\r\nUsing service virtualization for security testing in this way offers the following key benefits:\r\n\r\n•\tIt lets you derive more value from your existing functional test scenarios (since you can run them vs. dependencies exhibiting different security behavior). \r\n•\tIt enables extensive security testing to be performed without a security expert. Existing test scenarios can be easily executed against a broad set of preconfigured security scenarios.\r\n•\tIt lets you isolate and zero in on the security behavior of the specific components you’re interested in. \r\n",

This one hour session begins with a sweeping overview\r\nof the history of the UI for distributed applications to support that\r\nassertion.  There is a clear pendulum that has swung back and forth from\r\nclient to server in the 50 years since the first graphical interface for\r\na distributed application appeared.  \r\n\r\nThe sea change in HTML 5 is likely to shift the pendulum away from\r\ntoday's thin-client based server-side web frameworks like Struts 2 and\r\nJSF to JavaScript powered next generation rich clients. With strong\r\nsupport for REST, WebSocket and JSON, Java EE is well positioned to\r\nadapt to this change.\r\n\r\nIn this code driven session, we will show you how you can utilize\r\ntoday's most popular JavaScript rich client technologies like AngularJS,\r\nBackbone, Knockout and JQuery to utilize the core strengths of Java EE\r\nusing JAX-RS, JSR 356/WebSocket, JSON-P, CDI and Bean Validation. We\r\nwill also touch on Oracle's own JavaScript rich client solution code\r\nnamed project Avatar.\r\n",

If your boss only sees you when the app is down, however, that’s not really doing your career any favors. In this session we’ll talk about how to prove your value to the organization by looking at the positive side – that is, how much money you’ve saved your company. We’ll take a look at how you can use tools like Chef, Puppet, Sensu and Logstash to quantify your value to your company. After this session, you’ll be able to walk into a meeting with your boss ready to talk about your value to the company (and to ask for a raise).",

                "description": "Just released Vaadin 7.2 is the latest edition of the popular web framework that makes it possible to write HTML5 apps in Java. In this presentation we discuss three features in detail: Hybrid grid, parametrized themes and transparent server push already introduced in earlier Vaadin 7.1.\r\n\r\nFully redesigned data grid component works both on the server-side as well as on the client-side using GWT.  The goal has been to bring in the best data-grid component in any web framework and make it highly customizable. It supports everything between lazy loading, hierarchies, customizable data source cache strategies and lightweight cell rendering. Design and application possibilities are discussed in detail.\r\n\r\nNewly introduced parametrized theme allows one to build look and feels from Metro to Eclipse in one SASS based theme. Use of theme as a basis for your own applications is demonstrated and examples for what can be achieved are looked into.\r\n\r\nVaadin 7.1 introduced automated server-push that would allow use of websockets and http streaming just by adding one @Push annotation. This is demonstrated and built in RPC and state synchronization communications are discussed.\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that you know something about Vaadin before the session. Diving into the latest big features in Vaadin allows one to learn about the direction of developing web apps in Java.\r\n",

Organizations of all sizes are looking for alternatives to the existing world of on-premise database technology and looking to the cloud and “big data” technologies to deal with the explosion of data types and volumes available in their organizations. \r\n\r\nOver the years, Google has been an innovator in processing and analyzing massive amounts of information. Google has been responsible for inventing and developing many of the technologies that have been adopted by the IT industry to solve “big data” and computationally intensive problems. \r\n\r\nGoogle’s Big Data and Cloud Platform Expert James Chittenden will examine in depth, what it takes to succeed in deriving business value out of Big Data. We'll dive into Google's Big Data stack (BigQuery, Compute Engine + Hadoop, Building Big Data Pipelines, etc) as well as explore best practices when harnessing Google’s massive infrastructure in supporting those efforts.",
